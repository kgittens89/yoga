Start by lying down on the back with legs extended and arms at the sides with palms facing down. Using the abdominal muscles, the legs and hips are lifted up towards the ceiling, and the torso is brought perpendicular to the floor. Toes are then slowly lowered down to the floor behind the head with legs fully extended, if possible. Another option is straightening the legs fully after the toes reach the floor.

It is a seated posture with the legs outstretched in front of the body and the spine long and vertically aligned. The palms touch the floor beside the hips (or the fingertips can be used if the palms do not reach). Although staff pose looks relatively simple, it requires enough flexibility in the hamstrings and back of the body for the torso to make right angles with the legs. It also requires a strong core to hold the body upright, so it is considered a good posture for building inner strength.",
