### MVP Goals

- As a user, I want to be able to see a list of all available yoga poses so that I know what poses are available to me
- As a user, I want to be able to search for poses so that I can find poses related to my search 
- As a user, I want to be able to click on a pose and see more details so that I can learn more about that specific pose
- As a user, I want to be able to make my own sequence, so that my flow feels more personalized
- As a user, I want to be able to add a pose that might not currently be in the database so that I can better customize my experience






### Stretch Goals
- As a user, I would like sequences suggested to me so that I can learn how to pick the next pose in the sequence 
- As a user, I would like there to be a list of preset sequences so that I see the most common flow sequences
